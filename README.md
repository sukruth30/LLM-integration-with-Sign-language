# LLM-integration-with-Sign-language
This project focuses on Sign Language Recognition (SLR) using a combination of machine learning and a large language model (LLM) to translate hand gestures into coherent sentences. It aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities by improving sign language interpretation.
